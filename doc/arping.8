arping \- sends arp and/or ip pings to a given host
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBarping\fP [\-0aAbBdDeFhpqrRuUv] [\-S \fIhost/ip\fP] [\-T \fIhost/ip\fP] [\-s \fIMAC\fP]    [\-t \fIMAC\fP] [\-c \fIcount\fP] [\-i \fIinterface\fP] [ \-w \fIus\fP ] [ \-V \fIvlan\fP ] <\fIhost\fP | \-B>
.PP 
\fBarping\fP \-\-help
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIarping\fP utility sends \fBARP\fP and/or \fBICMP\fP requests to the specified \fIhost\fP and displays the replies\&. The \fIhost\fP may be specified by its \fBhostname\fP, its \fBIP\fP address, or its \fBMAC\fP address\&.
.PP 
One request is sent each second\&.
.PP 
When pinging an IP an ARP who\-has query is sent\&. When pinging a MAC
address a directed broadcast ICMP Echo request is sent\&. For more
technical explaination and an FAQ, see the README file\&.
.PP 
\fINote on timing\fP
.PP 
ARP packets are usually replied to (on a LAN) so fast that the OS task
scheduler can\(cq\&t keep up to get exact enough timing\&.
On an idle system the roundtrip times will be pretty much accurate, but
with more load the timing gets less exact\&.
.PP 
To get more exact timing on a non\-idle system, re\-nice arping to \-15 or so\&.
.PP 
# nice \-n \-15 arping foobar
.PP 
This is not just an issue with arping, it is with normal ping also
(at least it is on my system)\&. But it doesn\(cq\&t show up as much with ping
since arping packets (when pinging IP) doesn\(cq\&t traverse the IP stack when
received and are therefore replied to faster\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP 
.IP "\-\-help"
Show extended help\&. Not quite as extensive as this manpage,
but more than \-h\&.
.IP "\-0"
Use this option to ping with source IP address 0\&.0\&.0\&.0\&. Use this
when you haven\(cq\&t configured your interface yet\&.
Note that this may get the MAC\-ping unanswered\&.
This is an alias for \-S 0\&.0\&.0\&.0\&.
.IP "\-a"
Audible ping\&.
.IP "\-A"
Only count addresses matching requested address (This *WILL*
break most things you do\&. Only useful if you are arpinging many
hosts at once\&. See arping\-scan\-net\&.sh for an example)\&.
.IP "\-b"
Like \-0 but source broadcast source address (255\&.255\&.255\&.255)\&.
Note that this may get the arping unanswered since it\(cq\&s not normal behavior
for a host\&.
.IP "\-B"
Use instead of host if you want to address 255\&.255\&.255\&.255\&.
.IP "\-c \fIcount\fP"
Only send \fIcount\fP requests\&.
.IP "\-C \fIcount\fP"
Only wait for \fIcount\fP replies, regardless of \-c and \-w\&.
.IP "\-d"
Find duplicate replies\&. Exit with 1 if there are answers from
two different MAC addresses\&.
.IP "\-D"
Display answers as exclamation points and missing packets as dots\&.
Like flood ping on a Cisco\&.
.IP "\-e"
Like \-a but beep when there is no reply\&.
.IP "\-F"
Don\(cq\&t try to be smart about the interface name\&. Even if this
switch is not given, \-i disables this smartness\&.
.IP "\-h"
Displays a help message and exits\&.
.IP "\-i \fIinterface\fP"
Don\(cq\&t guess, use the specified interface\&.
.IP "\-m \fItype\fP"
Type of timestamp to use for incoming packets\&.
Use \-vv when pinging to list available ones\&.
.IP "\-p"
Turn on promiscious mode on interface, use this if you don\(cq\&t
\(dq\&own\(dq\& the MAC address you are using\&.
.IP "\-P"
Send ARP replies instead of requests\&. Useful with \-U\&.
.IP "\-q"
Does not display messages, except error messages\&.
.IP "\-Q \fIpriority\fP"
802.1p priority to set. Should be used with 802.1Q tag (-V)\&.
Defaults to 0\&.
.IP "\-r"
Raw output: only the MAC/IP address is displayed for each reply\&.
.IP "\-R"
Raw output: Like \-r but shows \(dq\&the other one\(dq\&, can be combined with
\-r\&.
.IP "\-s \fIMAC\fP"
Set source MAC address\&. You may need to use \-p with this\&.
.IP "\-S \fIIP\fP"
Like \-b and \-0 but with set source address\&.
Note that this may get the arping unanswered if the target does not have
routing to the IP\&. If you don\(cq\&t own the IP you are using, you may need to turn
on promiscious mode on the interface (with \-p)\&. With this switch you can find
out what IP\-address a host has without taking an IP\-address yourself\&.
.IP "\-t \fIMAC\fP"
Set target MAC address to use when pinging IP address\&.
.IP "\-T \fIIP\fP"
Use \-T as target address when pinging MACs that won\(cq\&t
respond to a broadcast ping but perhaps to a directed broadcast\&.
.IP 
\fIExample\fP:
.nf
.sp
To check the address of MAC\-A, use knowledge of MAC\-B and IP\-B\&.
.IP 
$ arping \-S <IP\-B> \-s <MAC\-B> \-p <MAC\-A>
.IP "\-u"
Show index=received/sent instead of just index=received when
pinging MACs\&.
.IP "\-U"
Send unsolicited ARP\&. This sets the destination MAC address in
the ARP frame to the broadcast address\&. Unsolicited ARP is used
to update the neighbours\(cq\& ARP caches\&.
.IP 
\fIExample\fP:
.nf
.sp
$ arping \-i <interface> \-U <interface IP>
.IP "\-v"
Verbose output\&. Use twice for more messages\&.
.IP "\-V \fIvlan\fP"
VLAN tag to set\&. Defaults to no VLAN tag\&.
.IP "\-w \fIusec\fP"
Time to wait between pings, in microseconds\&.
.IP "\-W \fIsec\fP"
Same as \-w, but in floating point seconds\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP 
You have to use \-B instead of arpinging 255\&.255\&.255\&.255, and \-b
instead of \-S 255\&.255\&.255\&.255\&. This is libnets fault\&.
